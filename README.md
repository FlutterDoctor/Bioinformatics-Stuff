# My Bioinformatics Journey Repository

Welcome to **My Bioinformatics Journey Repo**! This repository is a personal collection of resources, guides, Jupyter notebooks, data analysis, and AI algorithms that I am working on or learning about in the fascinating field of bioinformatics. The goal of this repo is to document my progress and share my experiences with fellow researchers, students, and enthusiasts who are interested in bioinformatics.


## Contributing
Although this repository primarily documents my personal journey in bioinformatics, I welcome suggestions, feedback, and resources that can help me and others in our learning process. If you have any insights or resources to share, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
