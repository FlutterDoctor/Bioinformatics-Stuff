# 30 day study plan:

**Week 1: Fundamentals of Biology and Bioinformatics**

**Day 1:**

- Understand the basics of molecular biology: DNA, RNA, and proteins
    
    **DNA**
    
    - DNA stands for deoxyribonucleic acid.
    - It is a molecule that carries genetic information.
    - DNA is made up of four nucleotide bases: adenine (A), cytosine(C), guanine (G) and thymine (T).
    - The sequence of these bases determines the genetic code.
    
    **RNA**
    
    - RNA stands for ribonucleic acid.
    - It is a molecule that helps to carry out the instructions in DNA.
    - RNA is made up of four nucleotide bases: adenine (A), cytosine(C), guanine (G) and uracil (U).
    - There are several types of RNA, including messenger RNA (mRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA), ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and small nuclear RNA (snRNA).
    
    **Proteins**
    
    - Proteins are large molecules made up of amino acids.
    - They perform a wide variety of functions in the body, including catalyzing metabolic reactions, replicating DNA, responding to stimuli and transporting molecules.
- Familiarize yourself with central dogma and the genetic code
    
    **Central Dogma**
    
    - The central dogma of molecular biology explains the flow of genetic information within a biological system.
    - It states that DNA codes for RNA, which codes for proteins.
    - This process involves two main steps: transcription and translation.
    - In transcription, the genetic code in DNA is transcribed into RNA.
    - In translation, this RNA is then translated into proteins.
    
    **Genetic Code**
    
    - The genetic code is the set of rules by which information encoded in DNA is translated into proteins.
    - It is a triplet code, meaning that each amino acid is specified by a sequence of three nucleotide bases (codon).
    - There are 64 possible codons (4^3), but only 20 amino acids. This means that most amino acids are specified by more than one codon.

**Day 2:**

    - The arrangement and placement of amino acids give proteins certain characteristics.
    
    **Levels of Protein Structure**
    
    1. **Primary structure**: A simple linear chain of amino acids (also known as a polypeptide chain).
    2. **Secondary structure**: Determined by the angles of the covalent bonds between and within amino acids.
    3. **Tertiary structure**: Determined largely by attraction between different parts of the molecule.
    4. **Quaternary structure**: Refers to how multiple polypeptide chains come together to form a functional protein.
- Familiarize yourself with protein-protein interactions and protein-DNA interactions
    
    **Protein-DNA Interactions**
    
    - **Role in biological processes**: Protein-DNA interactions play a significant role in many biological processes such as regulation of gene expression, DNA replication, repair, transcription, recombination and packaging of chromosomal DNA.
    - **Types of interactions**: Proteins interact with DNA through electrostatic interactions (salt bridges), dipolar interactions (hydrogen bonding), entropic effects (hydrophobic interactions) and dispersion forces (base stacking).

    - [Molecular docking is a computational technique used to predict the intermolecular framework formed between a protein and a small molecule or a protein and protein](https://www.bing.com/aclk?ld=e8YI-mQyVzO8tsq2OuPhrpdjVUCUwkSHtfdV7QkboP51VBszLDqRh55vt8RAlQ36PIklFgUCcWiqERbgcO8_H7LW3ifqZdRI7VyawaJjBePY1zNjPKhwZ0Y1CSgG7c77SZl8gX1yhdFmN-h_V9lLnHx9PBIve_DwhSI8ejrgbiJSx9VUXc&u=aHR0cHMlM2ElMmYlMmZvbmxpbmVsZWFybmluZy5obXMuaGFydmFyZC5lZHUlMmZobXglMmZobXgtcHJvLXBoYXJtYWNvbG9neS1jb3Vyc2VzJTJmJTNmbXNjbGtpZCUzZGEwNzE2OWY5MGEwODFiNGMzOWZjMGRlMzA2NmQyMTc3JTI2dXRtX3NvdXJjZSUzZGJpbmclMjZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtJTNkY3BjJTI2dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduJTNkRHJ1ZyUyNTIwRGlzY292ZXJ5JTI1MjBhbmQlMjUyMERldmVsb3BtZW50JTI1MjAoUHJvKSUyNnV0bV90ZXJtJTNkZHJ1ZyUyNTIwZGlzY292ZXJ5JTI2dXRtX2NvbnRlbnQlM2REcnVnJTI1MjBEaXNjb3Zlcnk&rlid=a07169f90a081b4c39fc0de3066d2177).
    - [Structure-based virtual screening (VS) has been a staple for more than a decade now in drug discovery with its underlying computational technique, docking, extensively studied](https://bing.com/search?q=molecular+docking+and+virtual+screening+for+drug+discovery+key+points).
    - [The idea behind VS is that a library of small compounds are docked into the binding pocket of a protein (e.g., receptor, enzyme), and among the top-ranked solutions per molecule, a choice is made on the fraction of compounds to be moved forward for testing toward hit identification](https://bing.com/search?q=molecular+docking+and+virtual+screening+for+drug+discovery+key+points).
    - [The underlying principle of VS is that it differentiates between active and inactive compounds, thus reducing the number of molecules moving forward and possibly offering a complementary tool to high-throughput screening (HTS)](https://bing.com/search?q=molecular+docking+and+virtual+screening+for+drug+discovery+key+points).
